## Passing Data To Views

As you saw in the previous examples, you may pass an array of data to views to make that data available to the view:

    return view('greetings', ['name' => 'Victoria']);

When passing information in this manner, the data should be an array with key / value pairs. After providing data to a view, you can then access each value within your view using the data's keys, such as `<?php echo $name; ?>`.

As an alternative to passing a complete array of data to the `view` helper function, you may use the `with` method to add individual pieces of data to the view. The `with` method returns an instance of the view object so that you can continue chaining methods before returning the view:

    return view('greeting')
                ->with('name', 'Victoria')
                ->with('occupation', 'Astronaut');

### Sharing Data With All Views

Occasionally, you may need to share data with all views that are rendered by your application. You may do so using the `View` facade's `share` method. Typically, you should place calls to the `share` method within a service provider's `boot` method. You are free to add them to the `App\Providers\AppServiceProvider` class or generate a separate service provider to house them:

    <?php

    namespace App\Providers;

    use Illuminate\Support\Facades\View;

    class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
    {
        /**
         * Register any application services.
         *
         * @return void
         */
        public function register()
        {
            //
        }

        /**
         * Bootstrap any application services.
         *
         * @return void
         */
        public function boot()
        {
            View::share('key', 'value');
        }
    }

## View Composers

View composers are callbacks or class methods that are called when a view is rendered. If you have data that you want to be bound to a view each time that view is rendered, a view composer can help you organize that logic into a single location. View composers may prove particularly useful if the same view is returned by multiple routes or controllers within your application and always needs a particular piece of data.

Typically, view composers will be registered within one of your application's [service providers](/docs/{{version}}/providers). In this example, we'll assume that we have created a new `App\Providers\ViewServiceProvider` to house this logic.

We'll use the `View` facade's `composer` method to register the view composer. Laravel does not include a default directory for class based view composers, so you are free to organize them however you wish. For example, you could create an `app/View/Composers` directory to house all of your application's view composers:

    <?php

    namespace App\Providers;

    use App\View\Composers\ProfileComposer;
    use Illuminate\Support\Facades\View;
    use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;

    class ViewServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
    {
        /**
         * Register any application services.
         *
         * @return void
         */
        public function register()
        {
            //
        }

        /**
         * Bootstrap any application services.
         *
         * @return void
         */
        public function boot()
        {
            // Using class based composers...
            View::composer('profile', ProfileComposer::class);

            // Using closure based composers...
            View::composer('dashboard', function ($view) {
                //
            });
        }
    }

> {note} Remember, if you create a new service provider to contain your view composer registrations, you will need to add the service provider to the `providers` array in the `config/app.php` configuration file.

Now that we have registered the composer, the `compose` method of the `App\View\Composers\ProfileComposer` class will be executed each time the `profile` view is being rendered. Let's take a look at an example of the composer class:

    <?php

    namespace App\View\Composers;

    use App\Repositories\UserRepository;
    use Illuminate\View\View;

    class ProfileComposer
    {
        /**
         * The user repository implementation.
         *
         * @var \App\Repositories\UserRepository
         */
        protected $users;

        /**
         * Create a new profile composer.
         *
         * @param  \App\Repositories\UserRepository  $users
         * @return void
         */
        public function __construct(UserRepository $users)
        {
            // Dependencies are automatically resolved by the service container...
            $this->users = $users;
        }

        /**
         * Bind data to the view.
         *
         * @param  \Illuminate\View\View  $view
         * @return void
         */
        public function compose(View $view)
        {
            $view->with('count', $this->users->count());
        }
    }

As you can see, all view composers are resolved via the [service container](/docs/{{version}}/container), so you may type-hint any dependencies you need within a composer's constructor.

#### Attaching A Composer To Multiple Views

You may attach a view composer to multiple views at once by passing an array of views as the first argument to the `composer` method:

    use App\Views\Composers\MultiComposer;

    View::composer(
        ['profile', 'dashboard'],
        MultiComposer::class
    );

The `composer` method also accepts the `*` character as a wildcard, allowing you to attach a composer to all views:

    View::composer('*', function ($view) {
        //
    });

### View Creators

View "creators" are very similar to view composers; however, they are executed immediately after the view is instantiated instead of waiting until the view is about to render. To register a view creator, use the `creator` method:

    use App\View\Creators\ProfileCreator;
    use Illuminate\Support\Facades\View;

    View::creator('profile', ProfileCreator::class);

## Optimizing Views

By default, Blade template views are compiled on demand. When a request is executed that renders a view, Laravel will determine if a compiled version of the view exists. If the file exists, Laravel will then determine if the uncompiled view has been modified more recently than the compiled view. If the compiled view either does not exist, or the uncompiled view has been modified, Laravel will recompile the view.

Compiling views during the request may have a small negative impact on performance, so Laravel provides the `view:cache` Artisan command to precompile all of the views utilized by your application. For increased performance, you may wish to run this command as part of your deployment process:

```shell
php artisan view:cache
```

You may use the `view:clear` command to clear the view cache:

```shell
php artisan view:clear
```
